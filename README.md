<p>The Typographics badges were made in less than a day using <a href="http://drawbot.readthedocs.org">Drawbot</a>, an excellent Python-based app for creating graphics. I automated them based on a static design by <a href="http://www.nicksherman.com">Nick Sherman</a>. The design employs <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/stilla-sh/?refby=n">Stilla SH</a> as well as a guest appearance by my in-progress typeface.</p>

<p>Check out the code, or view <a href="http://djr.com/misc/typographicsbadge/">a breakdown of the process</a>.</p>
